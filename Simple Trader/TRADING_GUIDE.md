# 🎯 Trading Guide - What Changed

## ✅ **Now You Know EXACTLY What to Do!**

### 🆕 **NEW: Click Items for Price History!**
Every item in the Step-by-Step Instructions now shows:
- **📈 Interactive price chart** - See 5-minute or 1-hour price movements
- **Trend indicator** - 📈 Uptrend / 📉 Downtrend / ➡️ Stable
- **Price change %** - Compare current vs historical prices
- **Volume stats** - Average trading volume per period

**How to use:**
1. Go to "Step-by-Step Instructions" section
2. Click any item to expand
3. See the price chart at the top
4. Check if trending up (good) or down (risky)
5. Verify current prices vs history

### 📥 **How to Buy**
1. Look at the **"Buy At"** column - this is your buy offer price
2. Place a GE buy offer at that EXACT price
3. Buy the quantity shown in **"Qty to Buy"**
4. Total cost shown in **"Capital Used"**

### 📤 **How to Sell**  
1. After items are bought, look at **"Sell At"** price
2. Place a GE sell offer at that EXACT price (already accounts for 1% tax)
3. Sell the same quantity you bought
4. Your profit per item is shown in **"Profit/Item"**

### 💰 **Understanding Profit**
- **Profit/Item**: GP profit for ONE item flip
- **Total Profit**: GP profit if you flip entire allocation
- **ROI %**: Return on investment percentage

Example:
```
Item: Dragon bones
Buy At: 2,500 GP
Sell At: 2,800 GP
Qty: 1,000
Profit/Item: 300 GP
Total Profit: 300,000 GP (12% ROI)
```

## 🎚️ **New Controls**

### 💰 Portfolio Value
- **OLD**: Slider limited to 10M
- **NEW**: Type ANY amount (100K to 100B)
- Default: 50M GP
- Your actual portfolio value determines allocations

### 💎 Minimum Profit Filter
- **NEW FEATURE**: Filter by minimum GP per flip
- Default: 5,000 GP
- High values (10K+) = only profitable trades
- Low values (1K) = more opportunities, lower profit/item

### Example Use Cases:
- **Conservative (50M portfolio, 10K min)**: Only show flips worth 10K+ each
- **Aggressive (10M portfolio, 1K min)**: Show all opportunities, even small profits
- **Whale (500M portfolio, 50K min)**: Only mega-profit items worth your time

## 📊 **Reading the Tables**

### Action Plan Table
| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Buy At** | Exact buy offer price |
| **Sell At** | Exact sell price (after 1% tax deducted) |
| **Qty to Buy** | How many to buy |
| **Profit/Item** | GP profit per single flip |

| **GE Limit** | Max you can buy per 4 hours |
| **Hourly Vol** | How many trade per hour (liquidity) |

### All Opportunities Table
- Shows top 50 items ranked by score
- Same pricing columns
- Use this to find alternatives if top items don't fill

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### GE Limits
- **4h Limit**: Maximum you can buy in 4 hours
- If qty > limit, you'll need multiple buy sessions
- Example: Limit 1,000 but recommended 5,000 = need 5 sessions

### Liquidity (Hourly Vol)
- **High volume (>100)**: Likely to fill quickly
- **Medium (10-100)**: May take time
- **Low (<10)**: Might not fill or take hours

### Price Trends (Coming Soon)
- Currently assumes prices are stable
- Future update will show if trending up/down
- For now: check in-game history before big trades

### 📈 **Price History & Trends (NEW!)**
- **Click any item** to see historical prices
- **Trend detection:**
  - 📈 **Uptrend (+2% or more)**: Prices rising - good for selling, wait to buy
  - 📉 **Downtrend (-2% or more)**: Prices falling - risky, might drop more
  - ➡️ **Stable (within ±2%)**: Safe to trade both ways
- **Use this to avoid buying items that are crashing!**
- Charts show up to 365 data points (5-min or 1-hour intervals)

## 🎯 **Recommended Strategy**

1. **Set realistic capital**: Enter your actual GP
2. **Set profit threshold**: 
   - New traders: 5K+ per flip
   - Experienced: 10K+ per flip
   - Whales: 25K+ per flip
3. **Check top 5 items** in Action Plan
4. **Verify GE limits** - can you buy that much?
5. **Check hourly volume** - is it liquid?
6. **Place buy offers** at exact "Buy At" price
7. **Wait for fills** (instant to several hours)
8. **Place sell offers** at exact "Sell At" price
9. **Collect profit!**

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

- Start with 1-2 items to test the system
- Don't exceed GE limits - you'll get locked out
- Higher volume = faster fills
- Use expandable sections for detailed instructions
- Refresh data every hour for updated prices
- If nothing fills, prices may have moved - refresh and try again
