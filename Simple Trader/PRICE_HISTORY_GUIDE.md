## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Always check trend before big trades**
   - Uptrend = Safe
   - Stable = Safe
   - Downtrend = Wait or skip

2. **Compare current vs historical**
   - If current buy is +5% vs start → might be expensive
   - If current sell is -5% vs start → margins shrinking

3. **Check the time range**
   - 5-minute data = short-term trend (last few hours)
   - 1-hour data = longer trend (last few days)

4. **Verify volume**
   - Higher average volume = more liquid = easier to trade

## 🚀 Pro Strategy

**For each item, ask:**
1. Is it in an **uptrend**? → Good for holding/selling
2. Is it in a **downtrend**? → Risky, might lose value
3. Is it **stable**? → Safe for flipping

**Then:**
- **Uptrend items**: Buy and hold, sell when trend reverses
- **Stable items**: Safe for quick flips
- **Downtrend items**: Skip or wait for bottom

## ⚡ Quick Tips

- Green trend (+%) = Gaining value ✅
- Red trend (-%) = Losing value ⚠️
- Bigger % change = stronger trend
- More data points = more reliable trend
- Check both buy AND sell trends

Happy trading! 💰📈
